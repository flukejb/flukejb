👋 Hello, I'm Joe Beaman! <br>
🌐 Networking Professional | 💻 Aspiring Python Developer
I am a networking professional with several years of experience in network engineering and infrastructure automation. Over the years, I’ve transitioned from traditional network operations to a more software-driven approach, focusing on cloud infrastructure and automation. Currently, I’m diving deeper into Python to sharpen my programming skills, aiming to become a more proficient software engineer.

🔧 What I Work On:
Cloud Infrastructure: I’ve worked extensively with AWS services like VPC, Transit Gateways, PrivateLink, Route 53, and EC2. I use tools like Terraform and CloudFormation to manage and deploy resources.
Kubernetes & Istio: My experience includes debugging service-to-service communication issues in Istio service meshes, as well as managing Kubernetes pods and deployments.
Networking: My background includes configuring Cisco, Juniper, and F5 devices, though I now focus on cloud-native solutions.
Automation: I’ve written scripts in Python to automate repetitive tasks and build internal tools. <br>

🛠 Technologies & Tools:
Languages: Python (currently improving!), Bash
Cloud: AWS (VPC, TGW, EC2, PrivateLink, Route 53)
Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, AWS CloudFormation
Containers: Kubernetes, Istio (operational experience)
Monitoring: Datadog, AWS CloudWatch
Networking: Cisco, Juniper, F5 (historical experience, now focusing on cloud networking) <br>

🎯 Current Goals:
Master Python: I’m focusing on improving my Python skills to pass coding interviews and solve more complex problems.
Expand Cloud Automation Skills: I want to leverage Python to create even more robust automation scripts and tools for cloud and infrastructure tasks.
